# AI_Guide_Dog_Semantics_Extraction.ipynb
This notebook include the pipeline for semantics extraction
1. ffmpeg to segment videos
2. Resnet to segmentation
3. Autoencoder

# AI_Guide_Dog_Semantics_Autoencoder_Train.ipynb
This file is used mainly to train autoencoder. 

# Model 
autoencoder_checkpoint_epoch_60.pth. Will be stored in drive.

# Extracted frames with fps=2 from dataset 1, 2, 5 in master doc (All videos recorded at CMU)
The extracted frames (extracted_frames) before processing and the processed masks (segmentation_input_extracted_masks.zip) will be stored in drive.
